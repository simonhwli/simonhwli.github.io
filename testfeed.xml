      <title>Why autism is often missed in women and girls | Kate Kahle</title>
      <itunes:author>Kate Kahle</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Women and girls with autism spectrum disorder often don't display the behaviors people typically associate with neurodivergence, greatly impacting when, how -- and if -- they are diagnosed. Autism acceptance advocate Kate Kahle makes the case for more research into this gender discrepancy, sharing her personal experience with masking, being diagnosed as a teenager and how it allowed her to better understand herself. "Autism is not a disease, and it doesn't need to be cured," she says. "It's just a different way some brains can work."]]>

      <title>How one small idea led to $1 million of paid water bills | Tiffani Ashley Bell</title>

It's an inspiring story of how one person with tenacity and an idea can create monumental change -- and a demonstration that each of us can find our own way to help the world, even if it means starting without all the answers.]]>

        <![CDATA[To restrain global warming, we know we need to drastically reduce pollution. The very next step after that: using both natural and technological solutions to trap as much excess carbon dioxide from the air as possible. Enter Orca, the world's first large-scale direct air capture and storage plant, built in Iceland by the team at Climeworks, led by climate entrepreneur Jan Wurzbacher. This plant is capable of removing 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. With affordability and scalability in mind, Wurzbacher shares his vision for what comes after Orca, the future of carbon removal tech -- and why these innovations are crucial to stop climate change.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[The fossil fuel industry is a factory of fairy tales, says activist and School Strike for Climate organizer Luisa Neubauer. Tracing the industry's five-decade trickle of lies about climate science, she busts the myth that economic growth and stability are dependent on fossil fuels -- and issues a resounding message about how we can actually move towards a just world. "[The future] won't be built for those who have brought us into this mess," she says. "It will be built for everyone else."]]>

      <itunes:author>Anil Ananthaswamy</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Our memories and bodies give us clues about who we are, but what happens when this guidance shifts? In this mind-bending talk, science writer Anil Ananthaswamy shares how the experiences of "altered selves" -- resulting from schizophrenia, Alzheimer's, foreign limb syndrome or other conditions -- shed light on the constructed nature of identity. He breaks down where our sense of self comes from and invites us to challenge our assumptions about who we are, with the aim of building a better you and a better world.]]>

      <itunes:author>Colin Averill</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If we want to better understand the environment and combat climate change, we need to look deep underground, where diverse microscopic fungal networks mingle with tree roots to form symbiotic partnerships, says microbiologist Colin Averill. As we learn more about which of these fungi are most beneficial to forest health, we can reintroduce them into the soil -- potentially enhancing the growth and resilience of carbon-trapping trees and plants. Hear more about the emerging science aiming to supercharge forest ecosystems, one handful of soil at a time.]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Technologist and TED Fellow Gautam Shah invites us to imagine how the metaverse could redefine the relationships between humans and other species. By giving individual wild animals a personal identity (such as Fio, a young orangutan in Borneo, or Mweituria, an elephant living in Kenya) and sharing data on their migration, milestones and habitats, Shah thinks we could empathize with wildlife in a whole new way. Learn more about how emerging technology could bring us closer to the natural world -- and what the connections we build there could mean for the future of the planet.]]>

        <![CDATA[Sugar intake gets blamed for a lot of health issues -- but when it comes to yeast infections, it's almost definitely not the culprit. Debunking myths (and strongly suggesting we skip heavily-marketed detox cleanses), Dr. Jen Gunter explains why having some yeast in the body is normal, how to know when it's a problem -- and what to (safely) do about it.

      <title>5 lessons on building an emissions-free city | Heidi Sørensen</title>
      <itunes:author>Heidi Sørensen</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Confronting climate change makes for better cities and a better quality of life, says Heidi Sørensen, director of the climate agency for the city of Oslo, Norway. From construction sites without noise pollution to fully electric transportation, she details the exciting green transition happening in her city. The Norwegian capital's ambitious goal of reducing 95 percent of its carbon emissions by 2030 is driven by a unique policy approach: a world-first carbon budget, which works side by side with the financial budget and clearly states what needs to be done, by whom and when for the city to reach its climate goals. She shares five crucial lessons Oslo has learned along the way to creating a better city for everyone -- and what it could mean for the rest of the world.]]>

      <title>Is there a role for carbon credits in the transition to a fair, net-zero future? | TED Countdown</title>
      <itunes:author>TED Countdown</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In June 2022, TED's climate initiative, Countdown, launched its Dilemma Series: events designed to look at some of the "knots" in the climate change space, where diverging positions have stalled progress and solidified into an inability to collaborate across differences. The event focused on the question: Is there a role for carbon credits in the transition to a fair, net-zero future? Through TED Talks and conversations featuring scientists, CEOs, activists, politicians, artists, frontline community leaders, investors and more, this film offers a 360-degree view of carbon credits -- a contentious subject that prompted some discomfort, disagreement and, ultimately, a renewed sense of possibility. It's an invitation to listen deeply, keep an open mind and get a little wiser on a complex topic. (Featuring, in order of appearance: Tamara Toles O'Laughlin, John Kilani, Nat Keohane, Julio Friedmann, Donnel Baird, Nili Gilbert, Al Gore, Inés Yábar, James Dyke, Tom Rivett-Carnac, Lindsay Levin, David Biello, Gilles Dufrasne, Kavita Prakash-Mani, Susan Chomba, Gabrielle Walker, Derik Broekhoff, Annette Nazareth)]]>

      <title>A new social contract for global climate justice | Huma Yusuf</title>
      <itunes:author>Huma Yusuf</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Pakistan contributes less than one percent to the global greenhouse gas emissions perpetrating climate change, yet one-third of the country was recently inundated with "biblical" floods that killed hundreds and displaced millions. If we're to move towards a sustainable future in the wake of such tragedies, the response will require more than just infrastructure repairs and a return to the status quo, says columnist Huma Yusuf. She shares a vision for global climate diplomacy where the countries responsible for pollution pay reparations for the damage they've caused, while developing countries bring forward a clean, green future. (Followed by a Q&A with TED Global Curator Bruno Giussani)]]>

        <![CDATA[We know diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) boosts creativity and profits, but progress has been slow: today, nearly 90 percent of Fortune 500 CEOs are white males. It's time for leaders to become "rock stars" of inclusion -- and that starts with pushing through discomfort to forge new connections, says veteran broadcaster and diversity leader June Sarpong. She presents examples of successful, creative DEI efforts and calls for leaders at the top to make the first move. "When it comes to diversity and inclusion, we need bold disruptors who are uncomfortable with the status quo, even if the status quo benefits them," Sarpong says.]]>

Working to make this 400-billion-dollar-a-year supply chain process as efficient and sustainable as possible, freight expert Oren Zaslansky digs into the logistics of filling these trucks to their maximum capacity through algorithmic carpooling (think: ride-sharing your freight) -- bringing with it the potential of a more transparent and eco-friendly global supply chain.]]>

        <![CDATA[Nearly fifteen percent of the world's population lives with a disability, yet this massive chunk of humanity is still routinely excluded from opportunities. Sharing her experience growing up with an autistic sister, disability inclusion advocate Meghan Hussey illuminates the path towards an inclusive future in four steps, and it starts with an attitude check on assumptions and stereotypes. Designing a world built for everyone is not a "nice to have," Hussey says -- it's critical to the fabric of society.]]>

      <itunes:author>Dan Harris</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[After more than two decades as an anchor for ABC News, an on-air panic attack sent Dan Harris's life in a new direction: he became a dedicated meditator and, to some, even a guru. But then an anonymous survey of his family, friends and colleagues turned up some brutal feedback -- he was still kind of a jerk. In a wise, funny talk, he shares his years-long quest to improve his relationships with everyone (starting with himself) and explains the science behind loving-kindness meditation, and how it can boost your resiliency, quiet your inner critic and simply make you more pleasant to be around.]]>

So whether you're sniffing the caramelized aroma of coffee, a whiff of trash or a trillion other things, your brain knows exactly what's under your nose.

        <![CDATA[Conservation champion and TED Fellow Adjany Costa is on a mission to empower Indigenous communities. Instead of imposing pre-designed policy and plans on local people, she says, conservation efforts should center those who know the land best, enabling them to tailor solutions to their unique environmental, social and economic realities. She presents a roadmap for Indigenous communities to take back ownership of their heritage and reclaim stewardship of their land.

      <title>How to transform the chemical industry -- one reaction at a time | Miguel A. Modestino</title>
      <itunes:author>Miguel A. Modestino</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Chemical plants create many of the materials found in everyday items, from the shoes you wear to the car you drive to the cell phone in your pocket. But the massive carbon footprint from chemical manufacturing is leading to climate breakdown. Sustainable engineering researcher Miguel A. Modestino presents his team's pioneering work on electrochemical engineering -- the design and implementation of new chemical reactions that source their energy directly from electricity, as opposed to fossil fuels -- and explains how it could reduce the world's dependence on oil and gas, protect its natural treasures and keep the economy humming.]]>

      <title>How we're reverse engineering the human brain in the lab | Sergiu P. Pasca</title>
      <itunes:author>Sergiu P. Pasca</itunes:author>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Neuroscientist Sergiu P. Pasca has made it his life's work to understand how the human brain builds itself -- and what makes it susceptible to disease. In a mind-blowing talk laden with breakthrough science, he shows how his team figured out how to grow "organoids" and what they call brain "assembloids"  -- self-organizing clumps of neural tissue derived from stem cells that have shown the ability to form circuits -- and explains how these miniature parts of the nervous system are bringing us closer to demystifying the brain.]]>
